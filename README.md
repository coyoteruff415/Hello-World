Welcome! I am working to make this a repository a collection of my very first projects in coding.
As of 04/05/2022, I have learned some fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and Python3.
I have an AWS account, but haven't done much with it yet.
I have learned how to use Git and Github to the extent that I can connect Github desktop to my text editor, Visual Studio Code, upload and fork repositories, push edits to files on the repository and document with concise comments.
On the hardware side, I have obtained an external hard drive and have learned to reroute programs and files so that I can use different machines and conserve space and security on my primary machine.
I have learned some fundamentals of licensing and open source theory.
Thank you for your support!
Riley

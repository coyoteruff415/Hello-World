	<h3>Food and Diet</h3>
	<h4>Opportunistic Omnivore</h4>
	<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300"/>
	<ul>These guys are so fun to feed! A healthy diet consists of:
		<li>standard sinking pellets</li>
		<li>dry flakes</li>
		<li>algae wafers</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Occasional shrimp, snail, or a blanched veggie make great treats</p>
	<h3>Behavior</h3>
	<h4>Crabby Personalities</h4>
	<p>Careful putting these guys in with slow moving fish and other competing crustaceans, as they are likely to fight to the death if hunger catches or another conflict arises.</p>
	<p>Our blue crayfish "Roy" is a feisty fellow, indeed. It took the lady at the pet store a hot 5 minutes to chase him down. He almost pinched me before we got him in his home tank. He chases the school of daneos around their tank almost ceaselessly and snags evey dry flake that falls within claws reach of his rock hide.</p>

	<h3>Blue Crayfish Aquarium Husbandry</h3>
	<h4>Water Requirements</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Temperature: 65-70F(19-24C)</li>
		<li>pH: 6.5-7.5</li>
		<li>Hardness: 3-10*dKH, 4-10*dGH</li>
		<li>Dissolved Solids: 100-300 mg/L (ppm)</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Tank Requirements</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Size: 20 Gallons or larger</li>
		<li>Substrate: Sand or gravel in which it is possible to burrow. Recommend to use blue substrate to stimulate coloration of crayfish.</li>
		<li>Plants: None approved</li>
		<li>Important to note is that this animal is limited to one per tank. Keeping more than one per tank will result in fighting, injury, and death.</li>
